# User Personas

Three aspirational personas representing different entry points into sacred geometry. All fit the "modern mystic" positioning — sophisticated people who find genuine meaning in geometry without the trappings of typical new-age aesthetics.

## The Mindful Creative

*Designer, artist, or creative professional*

Drawn to sacred geometry for both aesthetic and spiritual reasons. Has a meditation practice, appreciates intentional design, and sees geometry as a bridge between beauty and meaning. Might buy a print for their studio or use Signal to notice patterns in their creative process.

**Behaviors:**
- Follows design blogs and creative inspiration accounts
- Uses apps like Headspace or Calm
- Curates their physical space intentionally
- Shares tasteful, considered things — not everything

**What they avoid:**
- Anything that looks like a Facebook spiritual meme
- Clip art aesthetics
- Excessive adjectives and hyperbole
- Being sold to aggressively

## The Quiet Seeker

*Professional with a private spiritual practice*

Has a "normal" career but finds genuine meaning in symbols, synchronicities, and contemplative practice. Doesn't broadcast their spiritual side but engages deeply in private. Values discretion and sophistication — wants tools that feel like they're *for* them, not performing spirituality at them.

**Behaviors:**

- Reads across traditions — not dogmatic
- Appreciates quality over quantity

**What they value:**
- Privacy and personal space
- Depth without performance
- Sophistication in spiritual tools
- Being trusted to find their own meaning

**What they avoid:**
- Anything that feels like it's selling enlightenment
- Pushy community features or social sharing
- Being made to feel naive
- Public displays of spirituality

## The Curious Explorer

*Intellectually curious, came via math/art/architecture*

Discovered sacred geometry through an interest in patterns, history, or design principles. Open to spiritual dimensions but approaches from curiosity rather than belief. Appreciates content that respects their intelligence and provides context.

**Behaviors:**
- Goes deep on Wikipedia, follows references
- Appreciates primary sources and historical context
- Enjoys "how it works" explanations
- Skeptical but not dismissive — open to being surprised

**What they value:**
- Intellectual honesty
- Historical and mathematical context
- Content that educates, not just inspires
- Room to form their own interpretation

**What they avoid:**
- Content that assumes belief
- Vague language without specifics
- Claims without context or sources
- Being talked down to

## Using These Personas

When designing features or writing content, ask:
- Which persona(s) is this for?
- Would this feel right to them?
- Does this respect what they value?
- Does this avoid what they dislike?

Not every feature serves every persona equally. Signal speaks most to the Quiet Seeker. The geometry content serves the Curious Explorer. The shop appeals to the Mindful Creative. That's fine — just be intentional about who you're designing for.
