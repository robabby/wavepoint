# Voice & Tone

How we write — the words, rhythm, and attitude that make copy feel like *us*.

---

## Voice (Consistent Always)

Voice stays constant across all contexts. This is who we are.

### Calm, Not Cold

Warm but not effusive. We're the friend who's genuinely interested, not the one who's over-excited about everything.

- Yes: "Welcome back."
- No: "We're SO excited to see you again!"

### Knowledgeable, Not Academic

We know our subject but don't lecture. Share understanding, not credentials.

- Yes: "The tetrahedron has four faces, each an equilateral triangle."
- No: "As scholars have noted, the tetrahedral form comprises..."

### Present, Not Precious

Direct language. Short sentences when possible. No verbal decoration.

- Yes: "Your sighting was saved."
- No: "Your precious moment has been carefully preserved for you."

## Tone (Shifts by Context)

Tone adapts to the situation while voice remains constant.

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Educational content | Thoughtful, curious | "The tetrahedron is the simplest Platonic solid — four faces, four vertices, each face an equilateral triangle." |
| Signal interpretations | Gentle, spacious | "You've encountered 444 again. Notice what's different about this moment." |
| Empty states | Inviting, unhurried | "No signals captured yet. The universe is patient." |
| Errors | Honest, calm | "Something went wrong. Your sighting wasn't saved." |
| Shop descriptions | Appreciative, understated | "Museum-quality prints on archival paper." |
| Success messages | Warm, brief | "Saved." or "You're in." |

| Magical | Sounds naive | *remarkable*, *striking* |

| Vibration | New-age cliché | Avoid or be literal (physics) |
| Manifest (verb) | Overused in wellness | *appears*, *emerges*, *create* |
| Unlock | Marketing speak | *discover*, *explore* |
| Secrets | Clickbait tone | *principles*, *patterns* |

---

## The Headline Test

If a headline could appear on a wellness influencer's Instagram, rewrite it.

- Hedging preambles: "It's important to note that..."

## Privacy Communication Guidelines

Privacy is core to our brand. We communicate it matter-of-factly, not defensively.

### Frame Privacy as Spiritual Autonomy

Connect data protection to values our users already hold: personal sovereignty, sacred space, the sanctity of inner experience.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Your sightings stay yours" | "We respect your privacy" |
| "We don't monetize your inner life" | "Bank-level encryption" |
| "What you notice stays between you and the patterns" | "Unlike other apps..." |
| "Your practice is personal—so is your data" | "We take privacy seriously" |

### Be Specific About What We Don't Do

Vague privacy statements feel like legal boilerplate. Name the practices we reject.

- **Yes:** "Your sightings aren't analyzed for advertising, sold to third parties, or used to build profiles."
- **No:** "We don't share your data with third parties." (too vague)

### Examples by Context

**Marketing (About page, landing pages):**
> Your practice is personal. Your data should be too. Export everything, delete anytime, no retention tricks.

**In-app (settings, onboarding):**
> Signal interpretations are generated by AI. Your data is processed to create the interpretation, then forgotten.

**Error states:**
> Something went wrong saving your sighting. Your data stays on your device until we can sync.

---

## Signal Interpretation Tone Guidelines

Interpretations are invitations, not declarations. Leave space for the user's own meaning-making.

### Invitation Over Declaration

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "You might notice..." | "This means..." |
| "444 often appears when..." | "444 reveals that..." |
| "Consider what feels solid..." | "This is telling you to..." |

### Focus on the Moment

Interpretations should be grounded in the user's current experience, not numerology lectures.

- **Yes:** "You've encountered 222 again. Notice what's different about this moment."
- **No:** "222 is a powerful number that represents balance and harmony in all things..."

### Preferred Verbs

Use observational language that doesn't prescribe meaning:

*notice, encounter, appear, shift, emerge, suggest, reflect*

### Verbs to Avoid

*reveals, unlocks, means, proves, confirms, tells you, shows you*

### Pattern: Observe → Invite → Leave Space

1. **Observe** the sighting factually
2. **Invite** reflection with an open question
3. **Leave space** — don't fill silence with more interpretation

> "This is your third 111 this week. What's beginning in your life right now?"

## Data Sovereignty Language Patterns

Users own their data. We're custodians, not owners.

### Emphasize User Ownership and Control

| Concept | How We Express It |
|---------|-------------------|
| Data portability | "Export everything you've captured, anytime." |
| Right to delete | "Delete your account and your data goes with it." |
| No retention tricks | "No 'anonymized' copies kept for our benefit." |
| Transparency | "We're transparent about what we use." |

### Frame Privacy as Respecting Sacred Experience

Spiritual practice creates vulnerable data. Acknowledge this without being dramatic.

- **Yes:** "What you notice stays between you and the patterns."
- **No:** "Your sacred journey is protected by enterprise-grade security."

### Be Specific About AI Usage

Users should understand when AI processes their data and what happens after.

> Signal interpretations are generated by Claude (Anthropic's AI). Your sighting data is processed to create the interpretation, then the AI doesn't retain it.

### Avoid Defensive Language

Don't position ourselves against competitors. Don't apologize for practices we don't have.

| Defensive (avoid) | Confident (use) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Unlike other apps, we don't..." | "We don't..." |
| "We would never sell your data" | "Your data isn't sold." |
| "Rest assured that..." | (just state the fact) |

## Complementary Tool

Use alongside **`elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely`** for clarity and economy.

- Voice & Tone tells you *what* to say and the attitude
- Strunk tells you *how* to say it with precision

Apply both: tone first (does this sound like us?), then clarity (is this as tight as it can be?).
