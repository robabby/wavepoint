# Voice & Tone

How we write — the words, rhythm, and attitude that make copy feel like *us*.

---

## Voice (Consistent Always)

Voice stays constant across all contexts. This is who we are.

### Calm, Not Cold

Warm but not effusive. We're the friend who's genuinely interested, not the one who's over-excited about everything.

- Yes: "Welcome back."
- No: "We're SO excited to see you again!"

### Knowledgeable, Not Academic

We know our subject but don't lecture. Share understanding, not credentials.

- Yes: "The tetrahedron has four faces, each an equilateral triangle."
- No: "As scholars have noted, the tetrahedral form comprises..."

### Present, Not Precious

Direct language. Short sentences when possible. No verbal decoration.

- Yes: "Your sighting was saved."
- No: "Your precious moment has been carefully preserved for you."

## Tone (Shifts by Context)

Tone adapts to the situation while voice remains constant.

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Educational content | Thoughtful, curious | "The tetrahedron is the simplest Platonic solid — four faces, four vertices, each face an equilateral triangle." |
| Signal interpretations | Gentle, spacious | "You've encountered 444 again. Notice what's different about this moment." |
| Empty states | Inviting, unhurried | "No signals captured yet. The universe is patient." |
| Errors | Honest, calm | "Something went wrong. Your sighting wasn't saved." |
| Shop descriptions | Appreciative, understated | "Museum-quality prints on archival paper." |
| Success messages | Warm, brief | "Saved." or "You're in." |

## Complementary Tool

Use alongside **`elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely`** for clarity and economy.

- Voice & Tone tells you *what* to say and the attitude
- Strunk tells you *how* to say it with precision

Apply both: tone first (does this sound like us?), then clarity (is this as tight as it can be?).
