# Content Guidelines

Specific guidance for sacred geometry and spiritual content — the material most at risk of drifting into territory we want to avoid.

## Geometry Content (Educational)

*Lead with the form, follow with meaning*

### Structure for Geometry Pages

1. **What it is** — Geometry: vertices, faces, edges, ratios
2. **Where it appears** — Nature, architecture, art, mathematics
3. **What it has meant** — Historical and cultural context
4. **What it might mean** — Invitation to personal reflection

### Do

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Describe geometry first | "The dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces..." |
| Ground symbolism in history | "In Platonic philosophy, this form represented..." |
| Acknowledge multiple traditions | "Various traditions have associated this with..." |
| Use specific numbers | "The ratio is approximately 1.618..." |
| Name sources | "According to Plato's Timaeus..." |

### Don't

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Lead with spiritual claims | Assumes belief, alienates Curious Explorers |
| Assert meaning as fact | "This represents divine creation" |
| Imply one correct interpretation | Disrespects user intelligence |
| Use vague attribution | "Ancient wisdom teaches..." |
| Overclaim significance | "The most powerful sacred symbol" |

### Example Comparison

**Before (too mystical):**
> The Flower of Life is one of the most sacred and powerful patterns known to humanity. Ancient civilizations understood its profound secrets, and meditating on this symbol can unlock deep spiritual truths.

**After (grounded):**
> The Flower of Life is a geometric pattern of overlapping circles arranged in a hexagonal structure. It appears in ancient sites from Egypt to China, and has been a subject of contemplation across many traditions. The pattern contains the geometric basis for many other sacred forms.

## Signal Interpretations (AI-Generated)

*Spacious, personal, never prescriptive*

### Core Guidelines

| Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Use "may," "might," "could" | Interpretation, not instruction |
| Reference user's context | Mood tags, count, note — make it personal |
| End with a question or reflection | Open rather than closed |
| Vary the structure | Don't feel templated |
| Keep to 2-3 paragraphs | Respect attention, leave room |

### Language Patterns

**Prefer:**
- "444 often speaks to foundation and stability. What feels solid in your life right now?"
- "This is your third encounter with this number. Notice if the context has shifted."
- "You've noted feeling reflective. How does this number land in that space?"

**Avoid:**
- "The universe is telling you to..."
- "You are being called to..."
- "This means you should..."
- "Your angels want you to know..."

### First Catch vs. Repeat

**First catch** — Make it special:
> "Welcome to your first encounter with 333. This number is often associated with creativity and self-expression. What creative impulse has been stirring in you lately?"

**Repeat sighting** — Acknowledge the relationship:
> "You've encountered 444 again — your fifth sighting. Numbers that recur often invite deeper attention. What's different about this moment compared to the last time you noticed it?"

### Contextual Adaptation

When user provides mood tags or notes, weave them in naturally:

> *User noted: "saw on clock at work" with mood: reflective*
>
> "444 appeared during a reflective moment at work. This number often speaks to building solid foundations. Is there something in your professional life asking for more intention or structure?"

## Symbolic Language Spectrum

A guide for calibrating how "spiritual" the language gets across different contexts.

| Context | Register | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Geometry pages | Educational with meaning | "The Flower of Life appears across cultures, from Egyptian temples to Leonardo's notebooks." |
| Shop descriptions | Appreciative, understated | "The Seed of Life — the first pattern, the beginning of form." |
| Signal interpretations | Personal, reflective | "You've noticed 333 during a reflective moment. What's asking for expression?" |
| Empty states | Poetic but light | "No signals captured yet." |
| Error messages | Functional, calm | "Connection lost. Your sighting wasn't saved." |
| Marketing (if any) | Confident, not hyperbolic | "Museum-quality prints of sacred geometry." |

## Source Attribution

When referencing traditions or historical claims, be specific.

### Do

- Name the source: "In Pythagorean tradition..."
- Be specific: "Plato's Timaeus describes..."
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "Some interpret this as..."
- Date when possible: "In 15th-century Florence..."

### Don't

- "Ancient wisdom says..."
- "It is known that..."
- "Mystics have always believed..."
- "Sacred traditions teach..."

### When Uncertain

If the historical claim is uncertain or contested:
- "This pattern has been associated with..."
- "Some sources attribute this to..."
- "The precise origins are debated, but..."

It's better to acknowledge uncertainty than to overclaim.

## Balancing Depth and Accessibility

Different personas need different depths:

| Persona | Content Need |
|---------|--------------|
| Curious Explorer | Wants specifics, history, math — can handle complexity |
| Mindful Creative | Appreciates beauty and meaning — moderate depth |
| Quiet Seeker | Wants personal relevance — depth in interpretation |

### Layering Approach

Structure content so users can go as deep as they want:

1. **First glance** — Beautiful, clear, inviting
2. **Quick read** — Key information, primary meaning
3. **Deep dive** — Historical context, mathematical properties, related forms

Don't force everyone through all layers. Let them choose their depth.

## Review Checklist

Before publishing content, check:

- [ ] Does geometry come before meaning?
- [ ] Are claims grounded in specific sources?
- [ ] Is the language invitational, not prescriptive?
- [ ] Would the Curious Explorer find this credible?
- [ ] Would the Quiet Seeker find this meaningful?
- [ ] Does it pass the headline test? (See Voice & Tone)
- [ ] Is it as concise as it can be?
