# UX Guidelines

Persistent UX resources for Sacred Geometry. Reference these when designing features, writing copy, or making decisions about user experience.

## Brand Positioning

**Modern mystic** — sophisticated spirituality for people who meditate but also read design blogs. We're Headspace, not a crystal shop.

## Quick Reference

| Document | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| [Personas](./personas.md) | Understanding who we design for |
| [Design Principles](./design-principles.md) | Making UX decisions, resolving trade-offs |
| [Voice & Tone](./voice-and-tone.md) | Writing UI copy, content, error messages |
| [User Journeys](./user-journeys.md) | Designing flows, understanding emotional arcs |
| [Interaction Patterns](./interaction-patterns.md) | Building UI components, handling states |
| [Content Guidelines](./content-guidelines.md) | Writing about geometry, spirituality, interpretations |

## How to Use These Docs

**For new features:**
1. Review personas — which are we designing for?
2. Check design principles — what guardrails apply?
3. Reference interaction patterns — are there established approaches?

**For writing copy:**
1. Check voice & tone — what register is appropriate?
2. Review content guidelines if spiritual/geometric content
3. Apply `elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely` for clarity

**For design decisions:**
1. Return to design principles — they resolve most trade-offs
2. Check if a journey map covers this flow
3. Reference personas — would this feel right to them?

## Complementary Tools

- **`elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely`** — Strunk & White rules for clear prose. Use alongside voice & tone.
- **Design system** — See `src/components/ui/` for shadcn/ui components styled for this project.

## Updating These Docs

These documents evolve. Update them when:
- A new pattern emerges that should be standardized
- User feedback reveals a gap in our understanding
- A design decision sets a precedent worth documenting

Keep updates small and specific. These docs work because they're concise.
