# User Journeys

Maps of key experiences — not just what users do, but how they should feel at each stage. Use these when designing flows or evaluating whether an experience is working.

## Journey 1: Discovery → First Engagement

*A Curious Explorer finds the site via search*

**Scenario:** Someone searches for "Flower of Life meaning" or "Platonic solids" and lands on a geometry page.

| Stage | Actions | Feeling | Design Goal |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Arrive** | Lands on geometry page from search | Intrigued, assessing | Immediate clarity: this is quality content |
| **Explore** | Reads content, follows links to related patterns | Absorbed, learning | Reward curiosity — depth available, connections visible |
| **Notice** | Sees shop link or Signal mention | Curious but cautious | Soft invitation, no pressure |
| **Decide** | Leaves or bookmarks for later | Respected | No popups, no email capture nagging |

**Success metric:** They leave thinking "I'll come back to this."

**Design implications:**
- Content quality visible immediately — no walls, no gates
- Related content surfaced naturally, not pushed
- Calls to action present but unobtrusive
- No interruptions (popups, newsletter prompts, chat widgets)

## Journey 2: Invitation → Belonging

*A Quiet Seeker receives an invite from a friend*

**Scenario:** Someone receives an invite link, creates an account, and explores what's available.

| Stage | Actions | Feeling | Design Goal |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Receive** | Gets invite link via email/DM, clicks through | Curious, slightly special | Landing page confirms: you were chosen |
| **Enter** | Creates account with pre-filled code | Welcomed, easy | Friction-free — code already validated |
| **Orient** | Sees dashboard, discovers Signal | Exploring, unhurried | Clear paths, no overwhelming onboarding |
| **First act** | Captures first angel number | Engaged, personal | Celebrate meaningfully (first-catch moment) |

**Success metric:** They feel like this is "their" space now.

**Design implications:**
- Invite landing page feels ceremonial but not overwrought
- Registration is the minimum necessary
- First-time experience guides without lecturing
- First meaningful action is celebrated appropriately

## Journey 3: Casual → Committed

*A Mindful Creative moves from browsing to buying*

**Scenario:** Someone who's visited multiple times decides to purchase a print.

| Stage | Actions | Feeling | Design Goal |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Browse** | Views geometry content over multiple visits | Building familiarity | Consistent quality builds trust |
| **Connect** | A particular piece resonates personally | Emotional recognition | Content allows personal meaning |
| **Consider** | Explores shop, views print options | Interested but evaluating | Quality evident, no hard sell |
| **Purchase** | Selects print, completes checkout | Confident, treating themselves | Smooth checkout, anticipation for arrival |

**Success metric:** The purchase feels like an extension of their practice, not just a transaction.

**Design implications:**
- Shop feels like a natural part of the site, not a bolted-on store
- Product presentation emphasizes craft and quality
- No urgency tactics (limited time, low stock warnings)
- Post-purchase confirms they made a good choice

## Journey 4: Returning Practice

*A Quiet Seeker uses Signal regularly*

**Scenario:** Someone who's captured numbers before returns to log another sighting.

| Stage | Actions | Feeling | Design Goal |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Notice** | Sees an angel number in daily life | Alert, curious | N/A — this happens outside the app |
| **Return** | Opens Signal, navigates to capture | Familiar, efficient | Minimal friction to capture |
| **Capture** | Enters number, optionally adds context | Engaged, reflective | Flow supports quick or deep capture |
| **Receive** | Reads interpretation | Contemplative, personal | Interpretation feels relevant, not generic |
| **Continue** | Returns to day or browses collection | Satisfied, grounded | Clean exit, no engagement hooks |

**Success metric:** The practice feels sustainable, not demanding.

**Design implications:**
- Capture flow optimized for speed (can skip context)
- Interpretation quality maintains over repeat use
- No gamification pressure (streaks, daily goals)
- Collection view rewards return visits without demanding them

## Using These Journeys

**When designing a feature:**
1. Which journey does this touch?
2. What stage are users in when they encounter this?
3. How should they feel? Does this design support that?

**When evaluating an experience:**
1. Walk through the journey yourself
2. Note where feelings don't match the goal
3. Identify the friction points

**When something feels off:**
1. Check if you're fighting the intended feeling
2. Look for misaligned incentives (e.g., urgency in a "respected" moment)
3. Simplify toward the intended emotion
