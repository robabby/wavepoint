# Design Principles

Six principles for making UX decisions. Each frames a tension — what we lean toward versus what we avoid. When uncertain, return to these.

## 1. Grounded over Grandiose

Spiritual content drifts into breathless hyperbole. We stay rooted. Language is precise. Claims are contextual. The geometry speaks for itself.

**In practice:**
- "This pattern appears in Egyptian temples and Renaissance art" — not "This sacred pattern holds the secrets of the universe"
- Specific numbers and ratios — not vague "sacred proportions"
- Historical attribution — not "ancient wisdom"

---

## 2. Invitation over Instruction

We offer, we don't prescribe. Users bring their own meaning. We create space for interpretation rather than telling people what to think.

**In practice:**
- Signal asks "What energy surrounds this moment?" — not "You are feeling aligned"
- Geometry pages present what forms have meant — not what they mean
- Interpretations suggest possibilities — not directives

---

## 3. Quiet Confidence

Good design doesn't announce itself. Subtle animations over flashy ones. Elegant restraint. The gold glow is earned, not everywhere.

**In practice:**
- Reserve celebration animations for meaningful moments
- One accent color used purposefully — not scattered throughout
- Transitions that feel natural, not performative
- If everything glows, nothing does

---

## 4. Respect the Intelligence

Our users are thoughtful people. We don't oversimplify or hedge everything with disclaimers. We trust them to hold complexity.

**In practice:**
- Explain the geometry, not why geometry matters
- Skip "As you may know..." preambles
- Present context, let them conclude
- Error messages that inform, not coddle

---

## 5. Private by Default

Spiritual practice is personal. We don't push sharing, community features, or social proof. Signal sightings are yours unless you decide otherwise.

**In practice:**
- No social sharing prompts after captures
- No public profiles or activity feeds
- No "X people also saw this number"
- Data stays personal until explicitly shared

---

## 6. Craft over Content

Quality over quantity. One well-designed feature beats three half-baked ones. Better to have five beautiful geometry pages than twenty mediocre ones.

**In practice:**
- Ship less, but ship it right
- Polish before proliferating
- Say no to feature creep
- Depth over breadth

## Applying These Principles

When facing a design decision:

1. **Identify the tension** — What are the competing options?
2. **Check the principles** — Which ones apply?
3. **Choose accordingly** — Let the principle resolve the trade-off

Example: "Should we add a social feed to Signal?"
- Check: Private by Default says no
- Check: Quiet Confidence says no
- Decision: No social feed

Example: "Should the first-catch celebration be bigger?"
- Check: Quiet Confidence says reserve animation for meaningful moments
- Check: First catch *is* a meaningful moment
- Decision: Yes, this earns the celebration
