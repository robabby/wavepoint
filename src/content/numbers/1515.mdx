## Understanding 1515

The 1515 pattern alternates between new beginnings (1) and change (5). This clock time signals that transformation and fresh starts are intertwined. You can't have one without the other. The pattern appears when life is asking you to embrace both.

Let go and begin again. Release and initiate. Change is your launchpad, not your obstacle.

## What It Means When You See 1515

Encountering 1515 repeatedly may suggest:

- **Change enables beginning.** What you're releasing is making room for what you're starting. They're the same movement.
- **Expect disruption.** 1515 doesn't promise smooth transitions. The 5s bring turbulence that the 1s can ride.
- **Freedom through transformation.** The 5 energy craves freedom. Combined with 1's new beginnings, you're breaking into new territory.
- **Adaptability is key.** The alternating pattern requires flexibility. Be ready to shift between initiating and transforming.
- **Don't cling to what's changing.** The 5s won't let you hold on. Let go so the 1s can do their work.

## Working with 1515 Energy

When 1515 appears, consider these practices:

1. **Welcome the chaos.** 1515 often brings upheaval. Instead of resisting, look for the new beginnings hidden in the disruption.
2. **Start something different.** This isn't the time for more of the same. The 5 energy wants novelty; the 1 energy can deliver it.
3. **Release to receive.** Each 5 creates space for the following 1. What do you need to let go of to begin fresh?
4. **Trust your adaptability.** 1515 tests your flexibility. You're more capable of navigating change than you might believe.
