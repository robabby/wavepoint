## Understanding 1188

The 1188 compound pattern combines awakening (11) with amplified abundance (88). The master number 11 represents spiritual insight and inner knowing, while 88 brings doubled energies of prosperity, success, and material manifestation. Together, they signal that spiritual growth and material abundance are aligned.

This pattern suggests that awakening and abundance aren't separate paths—each feeds the other. Your intuition is guiding you toward both spiritual evolution and material prosperity. Trust that you don't have to choose between them.
