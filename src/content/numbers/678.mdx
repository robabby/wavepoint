## Understanding 678

The sequence 678 flows from balance through wisdom to abundance. Moving from nurturing care (6) through spiritual insight (7) to material prosperity (8), this pattern traces how inner development manifests as outer results. When 678 appears, it suggests your efforts are beginning to bear fruit.

This is a generative sequence—each element produces the next. Care and attention (6) cultivate wisdom (7), which in turn creates abundance (8). It's the pattern of seeds becoming harvest, of investment yielding returns, of effort compounding into results. The flow is natural and earned.

## Working with 678 Energy

When 678 appears, consider these practices:

1. **Notice what's ripening.** Where in your life are efforts beginning to show results? Give attention to those areas.
2. **Let wisdom guide resource flow.** As abundance comes, use the insight you've gained to manage it well.
